| Sample type                                           | Stratified random sampling (groups based on geography and demographics, random selection within each group). | Non-probability sampling (participants recruited from an online panel). | Convenience sampling (bats chosen based on availability) and purposive sampling (selected based on dietary and behavioral criteria). |
| Sample size                                           | Around 24,000 people completed the survey, from a starting group of about 50,000.         | 37,822 people filled out the survey during the election campaign. | 112 wild bats were caught for dietary analysis, and 15 captive bats were used for experiments. |
| Target population                                     | People aged 15 and older living in Canadaâ€™s ten provinces.                                | Canadians aged 18 and older, including citizens and permanent residents. | Glossophaga soricina bats in Costa Rica and captive bats in a UK lab.                       |
| Sampling frame                                        | A mix of landline and cell phone numbers tied to home addresses.                          | People from an online survey panel who met specific eligibility criteria. | Wild bats were caught with nets in Costa Rica, and captive bats came from a lab colony.      |
| Survey mode(s)                                        | Surveys were done online or over the phone.                                               | Participants completed the survey online by themselves. | Data came from fieldwork, lab experiments, and acoustic modeling.                          |
| Timeline                                              | Data was collected from September to December 2018 and released in January 2021.          | The survey ran during the 2019 federal election campaign, in September and October. | Field data was collected in late spring to early summer of 2009, and lab experiments lasted nine days. |
| Response rate                                         | About 42% of people responded to the survey.                                              | Traditional response rates werenâ€™t calculated, but 27% of participants answered a follow-up survey. | Not applicable.                                                                             |
| Weights                                               | Adjustments were made to make the results represent the overall population.               | The data was weighted based on age, gender, education, and province. | Not applicable.                                                                             |
| Data processing                                       | Data was cleaned and processed using specialized software.                                | Incomplete, duplicate, or unusually fast responses were removed before analysis. | DNA was extracted and analyzed, and bat sounds were recorded and synchronized.             |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            | Missing data was filled in using similar records, and multiple error checks were done.    | The dataset was carefully cleaned, but thereâ€™s no mention of filling in missing data. | DNA sequences were edited and matched to reference samples, and sound data was synced with video. |
| Sources of error                                      | Errors could come from sampling issues or missing responses.                              | Some groups might not have been included (like people without internet), and responses could have measurement errors. | DNA misidentification could happen if reference data was incomplete, and lab conditions might not reflect natural behavior. |
| Limitations, known biases                             | People without phones were excluded, and some groups may have been underrepresented.      | Response rates couldnâ€™t be calculated traditionally, and the sample doesnâ€™t fully represent all Canadians. | Small sample sizes, and captive bats might behave differently than wild bats.               |
